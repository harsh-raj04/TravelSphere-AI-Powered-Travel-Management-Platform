## 🧭 Project Overview

**TravelSphere** is a comprehensive, AI-powered travel management platform designed to transform how people plan, book, and experience travel. It bridges the gap between individual travellers, professional travel agents, and the global travel community through three distinct but interconnected portals.

The platform is built on a microservice-friendly monorepo architecture, with a REST + WebSocket backend, a relational + document hybrid database strategy, and a deeply integrated AI layer that powers everything from natural language trip planning to smart itinerary optimization.

### Core Philosophy

- **AI-First**: Every feature is enhanced or driven by AI — from auto-generating itineraries to smart agent matchmaking.
- **Community-Driven**: Travellers can connect, co-plan, share experiences, and review destinations collaboratively.
- **Agent-Empowered**: Professional travel agents get a dedicated workspace to manage clients, build packages, and provide real-time support.
- **Scalable by Design**: Built to scale from a small MVP to a production-grade platform handling thousands of concurrent users.

- `agents` — id, user_id (FK), bio, certifications, languages, rating, verified
- `bookings` — id, user_id, agent_id, type (flight/hotel/activity), status, amount, created_at
- `packages` — id, agent_id, title, description, price, destinations, duration, tags
- `payments` — id, booking_id, stripe_payment_id, amount, status, created_at
- `reviews` — id, user_id, target_type, target_id, rating, created_at
- `notifications` — id, user_id, type, content, read, created_at

#### MongoDB — Document Data

Flexible, rich document structures:

- `itineraries` — Full day-by-day trip structure with activities, notes, maps, collaborators
- `chat_messages` — Agent-traveller and group community chat messages
- `trip_journals` — Rich-text community journal entries with media
- `ai_sessions` — AI planner session history and generated plans
- `review_content` — Full review text, photos, tags (linked to PostgreSQL review ID)
- `group_trips` — Community group trip documents with shared itinerary

---

## 🔌 API Architecture

### REST API Design

All endpoints follow RESTful conventions with versioning:

```
Base URL: https://api.travelsphere.com/v1

Authentication: Bearer token (JWT) in Authorization header

Response format:
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { ... },
  "message": "...",
  "pagination": { "page": 1, "limit": 20, "total": 150 }
}
```

### WebSocket Events

```
// Chat events
"message:send"         → Send a message in a conversation
"message:received"     → Receive an incoming message
"typing:start"         → User started typing
"typing:stop"          → User stopped typing

// Collaboration events
"itinerary:update"     → Collaborator made a change to shared itinerary
"itinerary:cursor"     → Live cursor position in collaborative editor

// Notification events
"notification:new"     → New notification pushed to client
"alert:travel"         → Real-time travel alert (flight, weather)

// Community events
"community:post"       → New post in a group or forum the user follows
"buddy:request"        → New travel buddy request
```

## 🤖 AI Features in Detail

### AI Trip Planner — User Flow

```
User Input (natural language):

 interested in culture, food, and nature"

```

### Travel Buddy Matching — Algorithm

1. Users fill a travel preference profile (budget style, pace, interests, languages)
2. A vector embedding is generated for each user profile using OpenAI embeddings
3. When a user searches for buddies for a specific trip, cosine similarity is computed against users with overlapping dates and destinations
4. Top matches are returned ranked by compatibility score + mutual interests

## ⚡ Real-Time Infrastructure

```
Redis PubSub Architecture:

Client A (Traveller)
      │  WebSocket
      ▼
  Socket.io Server 1 ──── Redis PubSub ──── Socket.io Server 2
                                                     │  WebSocket
                                                     ▼
                                           Client B (Agent)

Channels:
  - chat:{conversation_id}     → Messages in a 1:1 or group chat
  - itinerary:{itinerary_id}  → Collaborative itinerary edits
  - user:{user_id}            → Personal notifications
  - group:{group_id}          → Community group events
```

This architecture allows horizontal scaling of WebSocket servers — any server can publish to Redis and all connected clients across all servers receive the event.
